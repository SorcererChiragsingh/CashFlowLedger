    # Deployment Steps Documentation for Setting Up This Project on a Virtual Machine with AWS or Google Cloud (Gemini API)
    
    1. **Set up the Virtual Machine:**
        - Log in to the AWS Management Console or Google Cloud Console.
        - For AWS: Navigate to EC2 and launch a new instance.
        - For Google Cloud: Go to Compute Engine and create a new VM instance.
        - Choose an appropriate OS image (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.).
        - Select instance type/machine type based on your requirements.
        - Configure network settings and assign a key pair (AWS) or SSH key (GCP) for access.
    
    2. **Configure the VM:**
        - Connect to the instance using SSH:
            - AWS: `ssh -i <keypair.pem> ec2-user@<public-ip>`
            - GCP: `gcloud compute ssh <instance-name> --zone=<zone>`
        - Update the package manager and install necessary software (e.g., Git, build tools, Python, Node.js).
        - Adjust firewall/security group rules to allow required traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH).
    
    3. **Set Up Gemini API Access:**
        - Obtain Gemini API credentials from Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
        - Store the API key securely on the VM (e.g., as an environment variable or in a config file).
        - Install the Gemini API client library for your programming language (e.g., `pip install google-generativeai` for Python).
    
    4. **Transfer Project Files:**
        - Clone the repository using Git: `git clone <repo-url>`.
        - Or upload files using SCP, SFTP, or Google Cloud Storage.
    
    5. **Build the Project:**
        - Navigate to the project directory.
        - Run the appropriate build commands (e.g., `npm install && npm run build`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    
    6. **Deploy the Project:**
        - Move build artifacts to the deployment directory if needed.
        - Set environment variables and configuration files, including Gemini API credentials.
        - Start the application (e.g., `node app.js`, `python app.py`).
        - Optionally, use a process manager like PM2 or systemd for reliability.
    
    7. **Test and Monitor:**
        - Access the application using the VM's public IP or DNS.
        - Test Gemini API integration by making sample requests.
        - Monitor logs and instance performance via AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, or locally.
    
    8. **(Optional) Automate:**
        - Use shell scripts, AWS CodePipeline/CodeDeploy, or Google Cloud Deployment Manager for automation.
